# Course overview
We are building a Twitter dApp today. The app will have the following functionality.
1. Sign-in via Twitter using Web3Auth
2. Write a tweet as NFT
3. Upvote and Comment on a tweet
4. Buy a tweet on OpenSea.
5. Interoperability of the DApp with Torus Wallet and Wallet Connect

This will be a very informative course on how to deploy an end to end application from scratch!There are 3 main modules to any E2E Application
- Smart Contracts
- Backend
- Frontend

Ours will be a web3 centric course where we will spend most of our time exploring all of the web3 aspects of the DApp.This will majorly fall under the Smart Contract & The Backend section.We will try to keep our discussion about the frontend brief, and focused on the web3 integration.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
